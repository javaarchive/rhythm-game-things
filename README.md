## current thing
there's a ddr pad style input thing in JOURNAL.md but this is WIP as I copy stuff from other platforms. basic idea is 

### out of scope in v1
* playing the other game that uses diagonal arrows and center because wiring that is a pita with cur design
* i want to try integrating a custom pcb instead of abusing wiring everything into a pico to make things nicer and symmetric (well the pcb is nice), but idk how PCBs work yet.
## notes
* transparent PETG + lighting is subject to avalibility of kinda transparent PETG 3D printing filament, it also needs to still meet strength requirements.
